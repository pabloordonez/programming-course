# Programming Course
In this course we'll try to acquire solid bases to understand what programming it's all about, what backend and frontend mean, and give the general tools for people to understand and try this at home. These courses will start as classes in spanish because we are based in Argentina, but the documentation will be written in english to be useful for as many people as possible. The author did not receive any format training, so if you find typos or bad written paragraphs, corrections and suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.
