# Programming Course
In this course we'll try to acquire solid bases to understand what programming it's all about, what backend and frontend mean, and give the general tools for people to understand and try this at home. These courses will start as classes in spanish because we are based in Argentina, but the documentation will be written in english to be useful for as many people as possible. The author did not receive any formal training, so if you find typos or bad written paragraphs, corrections and suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.

> **Note**: A general note about history and these courses: _The intention is to help people that didn't study computer science to grasp what programming is, and begin their journey. Some concepts may be simplified or not completely truthful if we see that reducing the complexity can help to understand certain concepts. There will be time to delve deeper in concepts like language and compiler theory if it's desired, but it's outside the scope of this series. The author encourages people to investigate more about these ideas, because they are the most fantastic and enjoyable concepts that the programming has to offer, and they make you a better programmer_.
